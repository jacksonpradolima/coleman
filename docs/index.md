**Multi-Armed Bandit based Test Case Prioritization for Continuous Integration**

Coleman is a framework that applies Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms to
solve the Test Case Prioritization problem in Continuous Integration (CI)
environments.

## Features

- Adaptive learning from test execution feedback
- Multiple MAB policies: baseline, Bayesian/stochastic, adversarial, and non-stationary variants
- Contextual bandits: LinUCB/SWLinUCB plus LinTS and contextual epsilon-greedy variants
- HCS support with WTS and VTS strategies
- Cost-effective prioritization under time budgets
- **Typed configuration** — Pydantic v2 models with YAML configs and composable config packs
- **Library-first API** — `run()`, `run_many()`, `sweep()`, `load_spec()`
- **`coleman` CLI** — thin wrapper: `coleman run`, `coleman sweep`, `coleman validate`
- **Sweep engine** — grid (Cartesian) and zip (paired) parameter expansion with seed replication
- **Deterministic `run_id`** — `sha256(canonical_json(spec))[:12]` for exact replication
- **Provenance tracking** — `spec.resolved.json` + `provenance.json` per run

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install coleman
coleman run --config my-experiment.yaml
```

Or use the library API:

```python
from coleman.api import run, load_spec

spec = load_spec("my-experiment.yaml")
result = run(spec)
```

See the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide for full instructions
and the [Configuration](configuration.md) guide for the YAML schema,
config packs, sweep engine, and determinism contract.
